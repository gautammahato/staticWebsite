        <p><b>I am learning satatic website on HTML</b></p>
        <p>I just blog about whatever I Do like writing about at the moment in which i am struggle . Things going on in my life; things from my past, nowdays; advocacy stuff…etc. My writing is…well, me. It’s my purest voice, and it provides a pretty in-depth glimpse into my thoughts and feelings.
            "Love yourself."

             How can a two-word sentence can be so powerful, that it has changed lives of milion people? 

             It is just a reminder that no one tells anyone. No one reminded us that we need to love ourselves. BTS did.

             When I first started it, I took a very simple step. Earlier, whenever I went through very hard time,
             I just wanted to leave the world. I might not really want to die, I just wanted to escape.
             When I came to know about Love Myself, what I did was during such bad times, when the thought of death was about to come in my head,
             I told myself, "Love yourself."

                <strong><p> A sort note About  <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">HTMl language.</em></p></strong>
                <p> <strong>Understanding HTML</strong><br>
                    HyperText Markup Language is the computer language that facilitates website creation. The language, 
                    which has code words and syntax just like any other language, is relatively easy to comprehend and, 
                    as time goes on, increasingly powerful in what it allows someone to create. HTML continues to evolve 
                    to meet the demands and requirements of the Internet under the guise of the World Wide Web Consortium, 
                    the organization that designs and maintains the language; for instance, with the transition to Web 2.0.
