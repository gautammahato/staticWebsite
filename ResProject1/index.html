    <p class="sectionSubTag" class="text-small">We, humans, interact with the world using our five senses. 
      But as the name suggests this technology brings forward an additional sixth sense. A sixth sense is an 
      ESP(Extra Sensory Perception) that aims at a more developed future with both the physical and digital world 
      connected without the help of hardware devices. We come to a step nearer to this goal of the sixth sense 
      with the introduction of sixth sense technology. The origin of sixth sense technology can be traced back to 
      Steve Mann who implemented a wearable computer in the form of a neck-projector coupled with a camera system 
      in 1990. In later years, following his footsteps, Pranav Mistry, a young research scientist at MIT came 
      up with new applications for this technology. Thus, the sixth sense technology was developed at Media labs 
      at MIT and was coined Wear Ur World (WUW). The device has various applications such as the drawing application 
      in which movement of the index finger is recognized and the user can draw on any surface. The other applications 
      include mapping, reading newspapers, checking time by drawing a wristwatch, etc. Other than being portable,
      The device has various applications such as the drawing application in which movement.The device has various 
      applications such as the drawing application in which movement 
      this device also serves as a computer and saves time spent searching for information.</p>

      Like senses enable us to perceive information about the environment in different ways it also aims at 
      perceiving information. Sixth sense is in fact, about comprehending information more than our available senses.
      that is used for high-speed video output. This port is used to connect graphic cards to a computer’s 
      motherboard. It increases the speed at which machines can render graphics while using the system’s 
      resources more efficiently. The primary purpose of an AGP is to convey 3-D images much more smoothly than 
      is possible on a regular PC.History
      The AGP was developed by Intel in the year 1996 and was launched in Socket 7 Intel P5 Pentium and Slot 1 P6 
      Pentium II processors. Gradually everyone started using it. Chipsets like VIA Apollo VP3, SiS 5591/5592, 
      and the ALI Aladdin V were the first Socket 7 chipsets to support AGP. Early AGP boards used graphics 
      processors built around Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) and were simply bridged to AGP. It can be 
      said that the AGP is built from the PCI that PCI is the base. Bridging didn’t help the cards benefit much 
      from the new bus except for the increased 66 MHz bus clock and the doubled bandwidth over PCI. Intel’s i740 
      was explicitly designed to exploit the new features of AGP. In fact, it was designed to texture only from 
      AGP memory.Characteristics of AGP
